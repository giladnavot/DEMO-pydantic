title: Basic Concepts of Validators
---
Validators in Pydantic are a set of functions or methods used to check and enforce the validity of data. They are used to ensure that the data being processed matches the expected format and meets any specified conditions. The <SwmToken path="/pydantic/validators.py" pos="1:6:6" line-data="&quot;&quot;&quot;The `validators` module is a backport module from V1.&quot;&quot;&quot;">`validators`</SwmToken> module in this repository is a backport from <SwmToken path="/pydantic/validators.py" pos="1:21:21" line-data="&quot;&quot;&quot;The `validators` module is a backport module from V1.&quot;&quot;&quot;">`V1`</SwmToken>, meaning it contains functions that were originally developed for a previous version of the software, but have been brought back into the current version for compatibility or convenience.

This is the <SwmToken path="/pydantic/validators.py" pos="1:6:6" line-data="&quot;&quot;&quot;The `validators` module is a backport module from V1.&quot;&quot;&quot;">`validators`</SwmToken> module in Pydantic. It is a backport from <SwmToken path="/pydantic/validators.py" pos="1:21:21" line-data="&quot;&quot;&quot;The `validators` module is a backport module from V1.&quot;&quot;&quot;">`V1`</SwmToken>. The <SwmToken path="/pydantic/validators.py" pos="3:7:7" line-data="from ._migration import getattr_migration">`getattr_migration`</SwmToken> function is imported from the <SwmToken path="/pydantic/validators.py" pos="3:3:3" line-data="from ._migration import getattr_migration">`_migration`</SwmToken> module and is used to get the attribute of the module.

```python
"""The `validators` module is a backport module from V1."""

from ._migration import getattr_migration

__getattr__ = getattr_migration(__name__)
