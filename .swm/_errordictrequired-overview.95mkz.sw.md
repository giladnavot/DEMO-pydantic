# What is \_ErrorDictRequired

`_ErrorDictRequired` is a class in the `pydantic/v1/error_wrappers.py` file. It is a TypedDict, which is a dictionary that allows for type checking. This class is used to define the structure of error dictionaries in Pydantic, specifying that each error dictionary must contain a location (`loc`), a message (`msg`), and a type (`type`).

# Usage example of \_ErrorDictRequired

`_ErrorDictRequired` is used as a base class for the `ErrorDict` class. `ErrorDict` extends `_ErrorDictRequired` and adds an additional `ctx` field which is a dictionary containing any additional context for the error.

```python
    class ErrorDict(_ErrorDictRequired, total=False):
        ctx: Dict[str, Any]
```
