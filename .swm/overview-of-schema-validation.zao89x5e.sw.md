title: Overview of Schema Validation
---
Schema Validation in Pydantic is a process that ensures the data being sent or received adheres to a predefined set of rules or structure. It is used to validate the structure and data types of Python objects. The `schema` module in Pydantic is a backport from V1 and is used to perform these validation operations.

# Schema Module

The `schema` module is imported from the `_migration` module. The `getattr_migration` function is used to get the attributes of the `schema` module. This is part of the mechanism that Pydantic uses to perform schema validation.

```python
"""The `schema` module is a backport module from V1."""

from ._migration import getattr_migration

__getattr__ = getattr_migration(__name__)
```
