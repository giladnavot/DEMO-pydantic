title: Introduction to JSON Validation
---
JSON Validation is a process that ensures the structure and data types of a JSON object meet certain predefined conditions. It helps to ensure that the data received is as expected and can prevent errors due to unexpected data types or missing fields. In the context of Pydantic, JSON validation is handled by the Pydantic models. These models define the data structure and data types, and Pydantic automatically validates JSON data against these models when the data is loaded.

## Using the `json` module for JSON Validation

The `json` module is imported from the `_migration` module. The `getattr_migration` function is used to get the attributes of the `json` module. This function is part of the migration process from V1 to V2 of Pydantic, ensuring that the `json` module functions as expected in the new version.

```python
"""The `json` module is a backport module from V1."""

from ._migration import getattr_migration

__getattr__ = getattr_migration(__name__)
```

## **getattr** Function

The `__getattr__` function is used for attribute access in the `json` module. It's assigned the return value of `getattr_migration(__name__)`, which suggests it's used for migrating attributes from the previous version of the module.

```python
__getattr__ = getattr_migration(__name__)
```
