  Exploring the interaction between class validator functions and Pydantic data
  models
---
This document will cover the interaction of class validator functions with Pydantic data models. We'll cover:

1. The role of class validator functions
2. How class validator functions are used in Pydantic data models
3. The interaction between class validator functions and Pydantic data models.

# Role of Class Validator Functions

Class validator functions in Pydantic are used to validate and preprocess the data before it is assigned to the model fields. They can be used to enforce type checking, value constraints, or perform transformations.

# Usage of Class Validator Functions in Pydantic Data Models

The <SwmToken path="/pydantic/functional_validators.py" pos="513:2:2" line-data="def model_validator(">`model_validator`</SwmToken> function is a key example of a class validator function. It is used to create a decorator that can be applied to methods in a Pydantic model. The decorator indicates that the method should be used to validate fields of the model.

```python
def model_validator(
    *,
    mode: Literal['wrap'],
) -> Callable[
    [_AnyModelWrapValidator[_ModelType]], _decorators.PydanticDescriptorProxy[_decorators.ModelValidatorDecoratorInfo]
]: ...
```

# Interaction between Class Validator Functions and Pydantic Data Models

The <SwmToken path="/pydantic/main.py" pos="543:3:3" line-data="    def model_validate(">`model_validate`</SwmToken> function in Pydantic's main module is an example of how class validator functions interact with Pydantic data models. This function uses the class validator to validate a Pydantic model instance.

```python
    def model_validate(
        cls,
        obj: Any,
        *,
        strict: bool | None = None,
        from_attributes: bool | None = None,
        context: Any | None = None,
    ) -> Self:
        """Validate a pydantic model instance.

        Args:
            obj: The object to validate.
            strict: Whether to enforce types strictly.
            from_attributes: Whether to extract data from object attributes.
            context: Additional context to pass to the validator.

        Raises:
            ValidationError: If the object could not be validated.

        Returns:
            The validated model instance.
```
