title: Getting Started with Decorators
---
Decorators in Python are a powerful tool that allows developers to modify the behavior of a function or class. They provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions. In the context of the DEMO-pydantic repository, decorators are used for various purposes such as backporting functionalities from previous versions. For instance, the `decorator` module is a backport module from V1, which means it contains functionalities that were present in the first version of the library and are still needed in the current version.

# Decorator Usage in [decorator.py](http://decorator.py)

Here, the `getattr_migration` function is imported from the `_migration` module and used as a decorator for the `__getattr__` function. This modifies the behavior of `__getattr__` to include migration-related logic.

```python
"""The `decorator` module is a backport module from V1."""

from ._migration import getattr_migration

__getattr__ = getattr_migration(__name__)
```

## Decorators in Pydantic

The `decorator` module in Pydantic is a backport from V1. It includes a function `getattr_migration` which is used for attribute migration. This function is assigned to the `__getattr__` attribute of the module, which is a special method in Python that's called when the dot operator is used to access an undefined attribute.

```python
"""The `decorator` module is a backport module from V1."""

from ._migration import getattr_migration

__getattr__ = getattr_migration(__name__)
```
